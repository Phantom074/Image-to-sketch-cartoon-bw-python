This project showcases how to transform images into sketches, cartoons, and black-and-white versions using Python with OpenCV and Matplotlib. The repository includes scripts that demonstrate:

- **Grayscale Conversion**: Converting colour images to grayscale.
- **Sketch Effect**: Creating pencil sketch effects using median blur, Gaussian blur, and adaptive thresholding.
- **Cartoon Effect**: Generating cartoon-like images using edge detection and bilateral filtering.
- **Black-and-White Conversion**: Converting images to binary black-and-white using adaptive thresholding.

These scripts provide a practical introduction to key image processing techniques, making it an ideal resource for beginners and enthusiasts interested in learning and experimenting with image manipulation using Python.
